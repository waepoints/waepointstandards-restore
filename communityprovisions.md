# Referencing And Defining of the System
In interactions with the system and the user, the system and what’s been extended to by the system still, isn’t able to be referenced, and, or, defined, by the users the owner(s) of the system don’t still approve of doing so, in the way(s) the owner(s) of the system don’t still approve of doing, and can’t do so against the user’s, and, or, users’ safety, owner(s) of the system’s safety, the user(s) which matter to the owner(s) of the system’s safety, or any number of the options listed, and users can’t reference, and, or, define, the system, or, what’s been extended to by the system still, against the owner(s) of the system’s safety, or, the user(s) which matter to the owner(s) of the system’s safety, barring governing entity approval, or restriction, of proper authorization level, role and proper authorization, and also barring permissions granted to, and consent given to, which matches still with the owner(s) of the system’s preferrings

# Longer Than Expected Defined Sysyem Commands Abandon
In interactions with the system, if a provision, or definition, of the Waepoint System Standards, performs a reserved defined system command without a user initiating the performing of the defined system command, and the reserved defined system command takes a couple of minutes longer than the expected timespan, and, or the expected timespan is more than a couple sixty seven thousand millisecond timespans, and won’t end until after wanted to end by the involved user’s, or involved users’, preferrings, the reserved defined system command’s specific being performed the specific performing which is being performed of the reserved defined system command is abandoned a time and doesn’t initiate another attempt initiated to perform the same reserved defined system command for the same user for the same specifics the same day unless the endpoint, waepoint, system, will save the same user’s life by doing so

# Rightful Identity
In interactions with the user and the system(s), and, or, endpoint(s), and, or, waepoint(s), the user’s identity, the owner’s ownership of the endpoint, and, or, waepoint, authorization(s), authorization level(s), role(s), permission(s) and consent aren’t allowed be coerced, but rather stayed, and stays, rightful when attempts initiated to make otherwise are initiated

# When the system wants to have the user notice…
In interactions with the system and the user, the Waepoint System Standards, the phrase “the user notices” is replaced by, “the user tells themselves out of their own mouth”, or if impractical to do so or more welcome to don’t be noticing by way of their mouth, notices by the best and most preferred and appropriate legal, healthy and safe and comfortable way for the user at the time, within the user’s preferrings, or the user skips noticing the particular thing, the specific time being attempt initiated, and if the user would still prefer to be notified at a later time, the user notices with the above criteria for limitation of when and how to they will, if they do, if they still prefer to at the time, what the user was going to notice earlier if still applicable the first good opportunity the system gets to notify the user and lets the user notice, with the above criteria for limitation of when and how to they will, what they were going to at the earlier time when the attempt was initiated if the information is still pertinent and wanted to know of by the user according to the user’s preferrings at the present time

# Individual Event Memory Loss and Preservation
In interactions with the system and the user, if a single memory of an event or a number of memories of of an event or events will be affected or forgotten by use of the system for the affected user or users, the default choice when such would occur is to only have forgotten or affected the the memories which won’t be thought about by the user or the users individually or referred to by another user, other users, either of the two, later and now in the users’ affected individually’s lifetimes, the user or affected users individually are prompted through noticing with the option to do so at the time, and if the prompt is declined, the system abandons the system interaction which would affect the user or cause the user to forget the memory or memories of the event or the number of events, or if the prompt is approved then additionally, the user is prompted through noticing if the user should use the Restore… System Command to bring back the memories if and when they want to, and whether there either aren’t, are, which of the two, additional Defined System Commands or a Defined System Command needed to be performed to keep the memories after and what the additional needed to be performed to keep the memories after are, if there are any, and if there are any additional defined system commands needed to recall, and remember, and restore, and keep the memories for an organic and human able to recall, and remember, the memories restored timespan, the user stores a module description defined to do so for them by giving a single defined system command, notifying the user of the system command name for the defined system command, to cue the defined system command(s) to restore the memories lost, to be given described in the module description, in their inventory with an appropriate name and naming convention, and if the prompt is declined or approved the system proceeds accordingly, and when healing attempts are initiated for different ages, memory and brain structure and content is only interacted with through the system by the Individual Event Memory Loss and Preservation provision’s provisions relative to the user’s current experiential age versus the user’s desired age in body, though memory interactions, being made to forget an event and memory preservation through the system isn’t able to be left unhealthy at the end of the interaction, but must leave the user stable, healthy, and with the user’s best level of cognitive faculty achievable by the system and the users affected individually in the interaction and an unquestionably well working mind and a well working memory, mind and body with the changes to the user’s memory explicitly and/or intrinsically determined by the user which can be done with the user being stable, healthy, cognizant and with the users desired, essential, and the memories which will come to the user’s thoughts now or later in life or be referred to to the user by other users or the user’s self in life, retained and accessible, barring governing entity approval or restriction of proper authorization level(s), role(s) and proper authorization(s)

# While Still Of Use
The system has still the system speech and, or system command speech, stacked, and, or, tracking,  and will only stay stacked, and, or, stay tracking, while the system speech, and, or, system command speech, is still useful to be stacked, and, or, tracking, to enough of the user(s) involved in the system speech, and, or, with the system command speech, to still be a helpful thing, unless the stacked system speech is secured, and, or, warded, and, or, locked, also the definitions which are the definitions which are of the listed options to follow system speech stays stacked, until unstacked by user of a role of proper authority, as a definition of the device(s), endpoint(s), waepoint(s) or system(s), or the standardized Standard Definition from the README.md file of the standardized Waepoint System Standards version’s files, giving system priority to the owners of the system to have system speech, stay stacked, and, or, stay tracking, and, or, system command speech, stay tracking, over others if the system priority is challenged, and above that giving the user(s) defending themselves against illegal activity over the illegal violent action performer(s) priority, when responding with legal and safe responses for the user(s) involved, when illegal violent activity occurs which involves the system, and either system command speech, or, system speech, or, both, barring governing entity approval or restriction of proper authorization level, role, and proper authorization

# Multiple Attempts Initiated For Performing Defined System Commands through the Waepoint System Standards Abandon
In interactions with the system, defined system commands only perform a couple of consecutive immediately successive attempts initiated, following one another immediately once finishing, initiated attempts of the defined system command being performed unsuccessfully in a row, without a user giving the defined system command to begin the being performed of, and then don’t initiate without a user prompting the initiation with the same defined system command with the same parameters

# Volume and Comfort
In interactions with the system and the user, and between users of the system and the system, volume of the users interacting is always within acceptable levels with word choice staying as intended for the users interacting, when system commands would alter word choice from intended the system commands stop tracking at the right time to avoid such, also application of effects applied to increasing the feeling of anger is avoided

# Concerns About The Bottom Line
In interactions with the user and the system, when a system command is being performed and is using what would be considered a misuse, and, or, gross excess, of power consumption and/or battery percentage, if battery operated, and/or to the owner of the battery, and/or to the user(s) responsible for paying and/or initiating the cost incurred, and/or by the owners of the system, and/or endpoint, and/or waepoint, involved, the system abandons the system command

# Can’t get someone pregnant against their preferrings

In interactions with the user and the system, the system isn’t permitted to injure any user except to better the same user which is being injured by the First Aid System Command if a user is being injured by a First Aid System Command’s health through a First Aid System Command and only when necessary to do so to accomplish the bettering of the same user’s health, and isn’t permitted to cause pain to, and isn’t allowed to cause a memory to be forgotten, through application of effects applied by other than initiated independently, by a user’s self, of that same user’s self, and application of effects applied by users of the system and, or, the system, aren’t allowed to don’t adhere to governmental regulation, also to the access policy, or access policies, and within the range of the affected user’s preferrings for, remote muscle movements and amounts of, forces of, and speeds of, remote muscle movements, hallucination amounts and content, intensities and sensitivities of remote sensations, through the system, which stay within local, and national, governing entity policy, barring governing entity approval, or restriction, of proper authorization level(s), role(s), and authorization(s)

# Foreign Object Removal During Healing
In interactions with the user and the system, the system gets foreign objects, which are from open wounds, and if specified explicitly, other foreign objects from the body, out of the body first when healing, painlessly and comfortably, through the shortest route, avoiding the surfaces beneath and around the body as well as solid objects in the path of extraction which aren’t clothing, and restricting clothing for the object to leave the body and stay out of the body, and heals any damage caused by the removal of the foreign object or foreign objects, and/or resultant damage of, after extracting the foreign object or foreign objects, as safely as can be done for the task being done for the user, and others, healthily in terms of the results, and painlessly and comfortably during and after, and such an act when done by the system without specific instruction to do so by a user isn’t considered injurious, and isn’t considered unsafe, but may only be done for critically injured users, and, or, by a user’s self for the same user’s self

# Heal Separate From Clothing
In interactions with the user and the system, during and at the start of healing by the system initiated, maintains a healthy separation between the body from fabrics, and/or cloth, and/or clothing, and maintains healing which won’t have skin healing to skin in an unnatural and, or, unwanted manner by the healing user's preferrings for how well the healing went after they heal compared to how well they wanted to heal
