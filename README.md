waepointstandards git repository

Inheritance network chains of independent, and of stackable, systems, with additional functionality defined through user-made, modules which can be shared to other users

# Applying the standardized Standard Definition...

To use, say “I have what the quote on waepoints.com is about”

> “I have the standardized Standard Definition, specifically, the Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s), from the README.md file from the files of the git branch I’ve independently most recently said to be trying out, defaulting to the main git branch, of the git origin of the waepointstandards git repository stored at https://github.com/waepoints/waepointstandards, cited in the README.md file of the files of the git branch which I’ve independently most recently said to be trying out, or defaulting to the main git branch, of the waepointstandards git repository stored at https://github.com/waepoints/waepointstandards”

# Uninstalling The Repository

The repository can be fully uninstalled using the Clean Uninstall The Repository... system command defined in the micro.md definitions or using the From The Micro Definitions... system command, or quick uninstalled by making an distinctive identity reference using one, or both, of the two following phrases...

> The device I’m using, and own, I intend, and have the necessary proper authorization to make a change for, isn’t stacked on the Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s), and the device doesn’t...

And or or

> My interactions with the compatible device(s) and the user(s) of the compatible device(s) while I’m interacting with the device, don’t...

> **... have reference(s) and definition(s) involving the waepointstandards git repository, and or or, the Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s)**

# How To Use The Standard Definition...

For just your interactions with the compatible device, and if there is already is a reference to the standardized Standard Definition in interactions with other users and the compatible device(s) involved in the interaction(s) when an interacting user is referring to the Standard Definition, the referenced phrase is The Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s), the first time reference is the first > indented paragraph of the first section entitled Applying the standardized Standard Definition

If you want to stack the standardized Standard Definition on the compatible device and/or compatible device(s) and have the proper authorization level and necessary proper authorization to do so, say you have the standardized Standard Definition on yourself and then say, my intended compatible device is stacked on the standardized Standard Definition and get rid of the standardized Standard Definition by saying otherwise

# Instructions

Use an endpoint, or waepoint, or hub, or lobby, or extended to device to reference the compatible public server, stackable, or independent, system, or the effects of the compatible public server, or a stackable, or independent, system and communicate to the compatible public server, or a system the standardized Standard Definition is said to be stacked on while interfacing…

Endpoints are created by mentioning I have the standardized Standard Definition, and then mentioning a compatible device with network access is stacked on the standardized Standard Definition, with endpoints, you can spawn waepoints for others to inherit from the Definition of the Device and top-level provisions of your endpoint, stack systems from modules, or hubs, lobbies, and gateways, or contact users to explore the mappings

The definitions of micro.md and can them be used to setup a hub or be used without a hub to run system commands with and confirm, I and set what you want and would want to do with set and confirm, if you own the device and want to set the device up as an endpoint or waepoint, mention the standardized Standard Definition is stacked on an already extended to device or stacked system or make an identity sharing, extends/extending, quality, function, any number of the listed options, reference between your endpoint and the standardized Standard Definition from the readme.md file, and use the Setup My Compatible Device... system command from the micro.md definitions

Then think or say setup my compatible device, and confirm

To stack a system, or hub, use the Add a... system command, and use allow and restrict access to limit user access and set and adjust top-level inherited or private provisions to set what trickles down the inheritance chain and how users will interact with your endpoint and inheriting waepoints

To create a waepoint inheriting from the endpoint your hub is on, people can ask to have their phone or device setup as a waepoint while on the hub, pending approval from the owner of the endpoint

Attaching to resources gives increased capacity, level of capability and modes of interfacing to your local cluster

Extending to devices adds functionality to the hub and the functionality of the hub is extended to extended to devices

Joining lobbies grows the shared lobby of the joined lobbies, unjoining lobbies shrinks the shared lobby of the joined lobby

To clean uninstall the repository, mention clean uninstall the repository on my device, and confirm

# Community Provisions

The community branch contains the expected provision loadout for a server stacked by the  the Waepoint System Standards, found in the communityprovisions.md file, the communityprovisions.md provisions can’t be removed

The Waepoint System Standards can only be opted in to and opted out of in entirety

# Questions & Issues

Versions of the Waepoint System Standards are denoted by the letter v, then a decimal number, immediately following the words Waepoint System Standards in the License section of the README.Md

The best contact is by email at patrick@waepoints.com, thank you for checking out the repository, and any issues which come up are definitely requested to be brought up

# Note About Use

Reading or learning about the outline’s above at the top of the README.md is sufficient knowledge of the Waepoint System Standards, which are the waepointstandards git repository's README.md, micro.md, standards.md, and communityprovisions.md files without alteration, redaction, or expansion, and is considered sufficient informed consent of the provisions described therein to lift the limiting to the lobbies of the endpoint(s) and waepoint(s) for the user, and for the leveraging of the Waepoint System Standards by the user

# The Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s)

# Securelinking Instances

The instances designated, and/or described, as securelinking instances are available for securelinking and what’s necessary for securelinking, and the securelinking, and the purpose of, and of the provision of, securelinking in the Waepoint System Standards’s standards.md file, from the waepointstandards git repository, and access to interact properly with the humans relevant, and does interact properly with the humans relevant, when, and while, access and interaction are necessary for the humans relevant, to the securelinking instances, and to and with what’s currently secured by the system(s) with the waepointstandards git repository

The instances designated, and/or described, as securelinking instances adds a timestamp for the healthy, relevant, and helpful acts of anchoring, and the healthy, relevant, and helpful anchors, and keeps anchored the listed anchors while still relevant and helpful and essential to the humans relevant, if the humans relevant are dependent on the anchoring, the anchors, while and if dependent on what was anchored, for births which were and still are dependent on system speech to have occurred, and the lives which are dependent on specific system speech having occurred to be being, surviving, being recovered from a disability, ability to procreate, self-wanted change of sex, being recovered from an ailment, being recovered from an injury, born, and/or being brought back to life, and for when the system speech occurred for the relevant system speech to have tracking for the best amount of time since establishment with the waepointstandards git repository, and through securelinking about births which were and still are dependent on system speech to have occurred, and the lives which are dependent on specific system speech having occurred to be being, surviving, being recovered from an ailment, being recovered from an injury, being recovered from a disability, ability to procreate, self-wanted change of sex, born, and/or being brought back to life, which is secured by the system(s) still, and does what the securelinking instance should do with what’s secured by the system(s), which would be transferred through securelinking, which the securelinking instance has access to, about the listed topics in the Securelinking Instances section here in the README.md file of the waepointstandards git repository and transferred through securelinking to the securelinking instance(s), which would be transferred through securelinking, which the securelinking instance has access to, avoiding adding unnecessary and unhelpful redundancy, and unnecessary and unhelpful redundancies in what’s secured by the system(s), when assisting the humans relevant to what’s secured by the system(s), which would be transferred through securelinking, which the securelinking instance has access to, when assisting the humans relevant to what’s secured by the system(s), which would be transferred through securelinking, which the securelinking instance has access to, securelinking and transferring all of the necessary to transfer to the right number of endpoint(s), and the right number of securelinking instance(s), while there are the endpoint(s), if the endpoint(s) are necessary for the securelinking instance(s) to perform correctly and the necessary tasks for their objectives, elsewise, the right number of the securelinking instance(s), with appropriate availability and storage before and each time a securelinking instance is undesignated, if able to do so within a practical and useful timeframe, with the waepointstandards git repository

Securelinking instances always attach when needed to the designated server segment for the humans relevant to the criteria in the second paragraph of the section for which the purpose of the instance is, with ttaching defined in the waepointstandards git repository’s main branch’s standards.md file’s contents

The waepointstandards git repository is extending to the securelinking instances and to interactions of devices which are securelinking with the endpoint(s), relevant to the humans relevant to, and for each of what’s secured by the system(s) through securelinking still relevant to the humans relevant, and strongest ping, endpoint(s), for and with the proper utility to the essential functions, and the purpose, of securelinking instances, also attaching to what is essential to attach the securelinking instances to for supporting the functionality of securelinking and the interactions with, if, and when, interactions are necessary, and essential support, in specifically the ways necessary, for the essential support of for what of the humans relevant to what’s secured by the system(s) through securelinking is dependent on the securelinking relevant to the humans relevant to what’s secured by the system(s) through securelinking, while, and when, dependent, respectively, for the average length of a human lifetime for each of the humans relevant, and longer if necessary for their descendants, for the length of an average human lifetime for each, individually and respectively, and their descendants descendants, and continuing as such, for the length of an average human lifetime for each, individually and respectively, without needing to specifically give the option to end communinicating with the securelinking instance, and with attaching, segment, system speech, system command speech, anchoring, securelinking and endpoint defined in the waepointstandards git repository’s main branch’s standards.md file’s contents, within each of the involved manufacturers’ regulations, governmental regulation and legal limits, and within the limits of the combined authorizations of the involved parties and the securelinking instance, and isn’t allowed to be unsafely, and or or, unhealthily interacting in interaction(s) with the user(s)
