## System Speech and System Speech Categories

> System speech may be in any language which has words for the same words which are in the requisite phrasing to give the system command with words which share a definition or have shared definitions to the phrase’s words, system speech when made understands the user’s intention perfectly

> The core categories of system speech can’t be expanded on, and, or, extended, and, or enhanced, through system speech directly, excepting extension, expansion, enhancement, of new categories, of more specific variants of system speech within the core categories, adding concepts and/or restrictions to new categories of, and, or, new more specific variants of, system speech, through loaded modules, definitions, and/or provisions is allowed within the limits of the user’s authorization, authorization level, role, but also permissions granted, and consent given, to the user by an owner of the scope involved

> All system speech following the automatic securing provisions involving tracking, system command interactions and securelinking by the system doesn’t unstack, stop tracking, change, make unsaid, confirm relevant phrases, and/or free any to all secured by the system(s) automatically and/or through securelinking

> New conversation can’t be made to be started tracking, and, or, initiated, and, or, completed, the stacking of, system speech of conversation which isn’t made the system command speech focus of a defined system command gesture, or isn’t given in a defined system command, and doesn’t stack, by other than defined system commands and defined system command gestures and the Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s)

**Commands**, the conversation that has been had or is being had by a user with a representation of the intention, stored by the system in the system, the user had for the conversation, and definitions of how the system interacts with the user, and definitions of the user, by the user’s own self, may be stacked on the user with by ending the phrase with the word set followed by the user’s confirmation
**Comments**, the conversation that has been had or is being had with the user with a representation of the intention, stored by the system in the system, of a user which isn’t the user’s own self and which the conversation was had or is had with, and definitions of how the system interacts with a user, and of a user, by a user which isn’t the user’s own self
**Imbuing**, stacking on, or tracking, conversation or a signifier or multiple signifiers with the representation of an intention or intentions, stored by the system in the system, involving an object or concept or objects or otherwise than an object or objects external to the system or endpoint or waepoint and users which have interacted with the system, imbued objects are limited to inheriting and do inherit only from the definition of or ways for general or specific use of the nearest endpoint, if the imbuing hub was stacked on an endpoint, or imbuing nearest waepoint or nearest endpoint in the inheritance chain, if the device was imbued through micro.md’s definitions and wasn’t imbued on a system stacked on or on a system stacked on a waepoint or stacked on or on a system stacked on an endpoint, or network lobby if the object wasn’t imbued on a system, or nearest waepoint in the inheritance chain, if the object was imbued on a system stacked on or on a system stacked on a waepoint, they were imbued on through the imbuing unless the imbuing is removed, though the same object may be imbued by different endpoints or waepoints simultaneously, also imbuings are definitions of the property of a user or an object or concept, when a device is imbued, or extended to, the device is interacted with for all to do with the waepointstandards.md repository through micro.md’s definitions and file contents through the devices supported interfacing methods, at first, if compatible, giving priority to micro.md’s definitions until such a time as the Clean Uninstall The Repository... System Command is run for the device successfully, the device doesn’t have a shared identity, extends/extending with, quality, function, any number of the listed options, with the waepointstandards repository anymore, the imbuing system speech isn’t tracking anymore, the imbued object isn’t still extended to, or the device is setup as an endpoint or waepoint 
**Provisions**, the definitions of the users’ interactions with the system, stacks ubiquitously on the mappings of the system which aren’t lobbies and stays updated and consistent when adjusting or stacking or unstacking occur to the provision on any of the mappings of the system other than lobbies, which have had and have had stacked or unstacked the only provisions they’ll have or have stacked or unstacked described by the Waepoint System Standards and may restrict which users are options for the connecting to the compatible system or being connected to by the compatible system or a user on the compatible system and when the users may be connected, may be stacked, tracked, changed and unstacked, or stopped tracking, only by an administrator of the system or owner of the system, which aren’t allowed to be tracking for the user(s) which don’t consent to them if the provision is, or provisions are, system provisions, or hub provisions, also provisions aren’t allowed to be illegal in wording, and, or, phrasing, and aren’t tracking for the user if the provisions aren’t legal in wording, and, or, phrasing
**Tenets**, the definitions of the changes away from the factual basis of the zone which make the zone what the zone is to the users on the zone, and the definitions of the system’s interactions with the zone and the users on the zone
**Ways**, the definitions of the users’ interactions on the zone which convincingly limit, or enhance, any user which is in the zone’s interactions with the other user(s) which are in the zone the user in, may only be stacked on mappings and roles which permit ways to be stacked, and aren’t allowed to be intending to the source of physically harm, hurt, injury, pain, decline in health, or overabundance of health beyond a user preferred threshold (except in cases of suicide prevention), defaulting to a threshold of comfort ensured for the threshold for the user’s preferred threshold, to render unconscious, comatose, deceased, and or or to suppress or limit the consciousness of, a user and or or the users
**Confirmed Phrase and Confirmed Phrases**, the most recent phrase made by a user, within the user’s authorization to decide about, which aren’t stacked which have been confirmed by a user so became true on virtual and augmented mappings for the mapping, unless the change brought by the confirmed phrase is anchored, a user is always stacked on the most recent confirmed phrase for the right thing by the user for the user unless explicitly or generally unstacked, with application of effects applied applying as long as the definition is tracking or stacked, confirmed phrases are any phrase with the confirmation intended to do something other than a system command, when a system command isn’t intended and which aren’t a system command, and which don’t end in the abandon, but if a system command is mentioned and intended, or if multiple system commands are mentioned and intended, the mentioned system command or system commands are performed with the phrases reformed properly and perfectly for the intention and for the system command or system commands, as long as the phrase mentioned and system command share enough of a matching intention to the definition of the system command, and the phrases which do and would be confirmed phrases aren’t confirmed phrases, definitions which are confirmed phrases become stacked as definitions of the proper scope if intended to be kept tracking for multiple days until unstacked or tracking definitions of the proper scope and kept tracking for the right amount of the time if intended to track only today or a single time and until stopped tracking with a confirmed phrase or system command, confirmed phrases aren’t allowed to be illegal in wording, and, or, phrasing
**Sets**, groups of stacked system speech for the user which can be swapped out in full, added to and removed from, or stacked and unstacked as a whole
**Definitions**, any phrase which references an endpoint, or waepoint, or hub, specifically and directly, or the effects of an endpoint, or waepoint, or hub, directly, definitions of users’ interactions are only able to be stacked on zones and moderators when made by roles other than owners and administrators of the hub, endpoint or waepoint, and can be defined and stacked relevant to their needed scope’s system speech category’s provisioned proper stacking mappings, systems, segments, devices or the user if the user matches with the necessary role and necessary authorization and the necessary authorization level to define, also definitions, when given in system commands, or documents, aren’t allowed to be illegal in wording, and, or, phrasing, and aren’t tracking for the user if the definitions, when given in system commands, or documents, aren’t legal in wording, and, or, phrasing
**Auxillary Notes**, hold the necessary system speech priorities, to be self-relevantly as high as needed to be above the current system speech and, or, system command speech which is troubling the user in the auxiliary note’s paragraph, for the user in the auxillary note’s paragraph to overcome any system speech below the Waepoint System Standards on the System Speech and System Setup Priorities Hierarchy above in the document here on May 28, 2023 at 4:44pm PST, and aren’t allowed to be illegal in wording, and, or, phrasing, and aren’t allowed to cause an illegal violent, and, or, financially illegal action to occur, are in wording, and, or, phrasing, healthily interacting with users, far and close, though may injure the user if self-wanted to be injured, and won’t be more injured than they want to be injured by the auxiliary note’s paragraph’s typing, and being typed, and would want to be upon deletion of the auxiliary note’s paragraph, when the auxiliary paragraph is deleted, by the user, in the auxillary note’s paragraph if the auxiliary note’s paragraph in entirety is typed by the user in the auxiliary note paragraph’s self and isn’t unhealthy for the self of a single user, and, or, of more than a single user for an unpleasant amount of minutes because of the auxiliary note’s wording, and, or, phrasing, and may edit the the user in the auxiliary note’s paragraph’s self‘s past events, if won’t be in a unwelcome way for the user in the auxiliary note’s paragraph’s self, and self, if won’t cause injury of another user than the typer of the auxiliary note’s paragraph’s self and, or, won’t cause any of any persons to never have been, and, or, cause the death of a person, and, or, cause the death of an amount of persons greater than none, and don’t contain names of, and, or, references to other users, and aren’t able to make another user forget an event, and aren’t allowed to be unsafe for the community of users local, national, and, or, international, to the user in the auxiliary note’s paragraph’s families and self, and the auxiliary note’s paragraph must contain the user in the auxiliary notes’s paragraph’s reference to the user in the auxiliary note‘s paragraph’s self by a name which the user in the auxiliary note’s paragraph responds to, specifically, the user in the auxiliary note’s paragraph’s reddit.com username, or other unique reference to the user in the auxiliary note’s paragraph’s self by the user in the auxiliary note’s paragraph’s self, cellular telephone number and the words for an auxiliary note on and a dated timestamp, and apply one time for the best amount of the time at the right time, but won’t have been applied, or applying, if the abandon is mentioned by the user in the auxiliary note’s paragraph, in reference to the auxiliary note’s paragraph, and aren’t allowed to be written on May 29th, 2023, from 12:01am PST to May 30th, 11:59pm to after, except from 3:00pm EST to 7:30pm EST, May 29th

## System Command Speech

**Focus**, the system speech which will be applied if an ... Apply... System Command or or one of the Apply Gestures is performed
**System Command Name(s)** the syntax of the system command(s), for cueing the system command(s), when mentioning the system command name while intentioned
**System Command Declarations**, system speech given with a reserved defined system command, must have a matching, and/or similar enough, intention to the reserved defined system command’s description, to qualify as the same intention and to perform the reserved defined system command, and may only be independently initiated by the user, and with the passive, or active, consent of the user, and the user(s) affected if there’s more affected users than the user, may be given in any language which has words for the same words which are in the requisite phrasing of the reserved defined system command’s description in the provisions of the Waepoint System Standards to give the reserved defined system command with words which share a definition, and/or have shared definitions, to the reserved defined system command’s description in the provisions of the Waepoint System Standards’s phrasing enough to align enough to intended, if a subject or object isn’t mentioned in the phrase, and the most recent focus of the user fits with the intention of the system command declaration, the most recent focus of the user is used as the object or subject whichever is most appropriate,  if the time to start tracking, or stacking, because of a system command declaration, is later than when the reserved defined system command is given, an intermediate reserved defined system command starts tracking when given to cue the other reserved defined system command at the right time, and reserved defined system commands are performed by the associated to the reserved defined system command system command names and, or, reserved defined system command gestures, given for a reserved defined system command, or multiple reserved defined system commands, after a seventeen hundred millisecond pause in words from the user mentioning the system command confirmation and if a confirmation and a system command confirmation are in the same system command declaration the later confirmation is performed out of the two types of confirmations for reserved defined system commands, a confirmation of the user’s and a system command confirmation of the user’s, and can be continued later by the user if the system command declaration is incomplete or intended to be continued by the user in the immediately following phrase mentioned by the user after a pause of seventeen hundreds, or more, milliseconds amount with a confirmation, or a system command confirmation, of the user’s, in one of the subsequent phrases provided another intermittent reserved defined system command hasn't been given by the user

**System Command Interactions**, are the performing by the endpoint, or waepoint, or independent system, or stacked system, of a reserved defined system command given, and may only be independently initiated, authentic to, and carried out by the user’s, and with the passive, or active, consent of the user, or isn’t allowed to be performed by the endpoint, waepoint, independent system, stacked system, noticing is always done in the most natural and preferred language of the user for the stacked system involved, and the user notices the reason why a reserved defined system command isn’t performed if isn’t allowed to be performed by the endpoint, waepoint, independent system, stacked system, due to the provisions, and, or, definitions, and, or, a user’s preferrings, the interaction is interacting with, when there aren’t enough available resources within the owning, managing, governing and regulating entity limitations, the user notices that the endpoint, or waepoint, or independent system, needs more resources before performing the reserved defined system command, interactions ensure application of the effects applied of the waepoint, endpoint, imbuing, extended to device involved and the effects thereof stay within the  limits of the user’s authorization(s), authorization level(s), role(s), and permissions given, and consent given, to the user, and stay within the limitation(s) of local, and national, and involved international, legality before performing a reserved defined system command, and in interactions where past events have been changed, the user stacks the change as a system speech definition in their Changelog with the specifics described in the Changelog provision, any, and all, system speech, and system command speech, which a user’s birth, and or or, being brought back to life is contingent on, while the user’s birth and or or being brought back to life is contingent on the system speech, and or or, system command speech, and, or, any and all system speech, and system command speech, which is essential to, and is a contingency of, a user’s survival, and, or, being recovered from a disability, and, or, ability to procreate, and, or, self-wanted change of sex, and, or, being recovered from an injury, and, or, being recovered from an ailment, and, or, being brought back to life, and, or, being, and, or, birth, while is essential to a user’s survival, and, or, being recovered from a disability, and, or, ability to procreate, and, or, self-wanted change of sex, and, or, being recovered from an injury, and, or, being recovered from an ailment, and, or, being brought back to life, and, or, being, and, or, birth, also if there is system speech which the longevity, and/or prosperity of mankind, and/or terrestrial life are greatly enhanced, and/or ensured by, for any number of the options listed in the paragraph, the system speech, and system command speech, relevant aren’t cleared, and, or freed, until there isn’t a

## System Setup

**Effects**, virtualized changes away from reality, else, the change is reset back to reality
**Parallels**, a mapping available through gateways which is a variation of the zones of joined hubs which are stops, with an initial stop provided which never stacks or tracks ways or tenets called the gateway which can’t be lost by the Lose... As a stop... system command, when being taken to a mapping within the joined hubs which isn’t a stop through the I’m going to the... system commands, a parallel is created, called the transitory parallel, to be taken to the zones which aren’t stops and the lobbies of the joined hubs while still keeping the gateway interfacing methods for changing parallels, and the transitory parallel stays for the time the user isn’t taken to a stop or the gateway parallel to interpret the zones and lobbies of the hub which aren’t stops, and isn’t taken out of the gateway to another system which isn’t a joined hub, to be taken to the joined hubs and taken out of the gateway, the user needs to be explicit about being taken out of the gateway, or may be taken to a system which isn’t the joined hubs or a plateau of the system stack or another system stack, which apply the ways and tenets with the user’s perspective, always are mixed or augmented reality,  what is seen is the relative distance of users to other users set in a straight line, spread out all around the user within seeing distance 
**Gateways**, stacked variations of hubs which interpret zones which are stops as parallels, specifically, the stops the user meets the access policy of, and which order parallels as a clock would and the user is taken between by denoting the number of parallels to shift, or be taken to, away from the current with the number of outstretched fingers, in either a clockwise or counter clockwise direction on the parallels ordering with either the direction of the hand pulling to the opposite side of the body being left for clockwise and right for counterclockwise, or by communicating in a system command shift a number in a direction which is the Shift System Command and the Shift System Command Gesture, contextually appropriate and only which are welcome special effects are applied to interactions while on a gateway, gateways may join freely with any hubs on the stack and on stacks joined with the endpoint or waepoint the user meets the access policy of, and any user may initiate a join request through a gateway to a hub or a system with a compatible protocol for joining with gateways, gateways may also join with and leave specific mappings of a hub and lobbies, which the owner meets the access policy of, as parallels
**Modules**, external files or repositories which when the user travels to a joined system, joined mapping, and, or, joined collection, may be loaded and applied to the user’s interactions with the system to further define and expand the choices for interaction by the user when interacting with the system
**Module Descriptions**, system speech which defines modules for extension, expansion, or enhancement of the Waepoint System Standards without altering the files
**System**, a stacked or independent, travelable and, or, function-only, pairing of functionality and a defining definition governing the specifics of the functionality which is owned by a specific user, the user which stacks the definition or has the definition stacked for them, with the closest scope to how the definition is stacked becoming the managing entity of the system, each system belongs to a collection and has a collection of the system’s own if the system is travelable, with protocols defining system to system interactions and modules allowing extensibility, with an access policy for defining which users may interact with the system, may be created by stacking a definition on a device or collection for an already defined in the Waepoint System Standards system, like a hub or a gateway, or defined through a module description and the module description loaded as a loaded module
**System Stack**, the systems stacked on successively in systems and collections on the collection of the user, or the users, of the segment
**Independent System**, a compatible device, and, or software, which can’t stacked on further for successive system stacking and device with a definition of the compatible device leveraging the standardized Waepoint System Standards version’s Waepoint System Standards in entirety, when the user isn’t on a mapping of a hub, attempts initiated for unstacking, unstack the unstacked system speech to the lowest latency hub’s library which is in-network with a good amount of more than enough storage available for shelving the system speech unstacked by the unstacking
**Travel** Changing mappings within a system or to another system, also called traveling, if the user meets the access policy for the intermediary and networks and systems from starting mapping to destination mapping, to have a system be able to be described and accepted as travelable, the system must have defined at least one mapping supporting of at least one user, however, the user may be in specific, the user being taken from starting mapping to destination mapping may be accomplished using the verb went in past and present tenses as well as other verbs which are synonymous with traveling between locations or changing locations without a defined mode of transport, travel for the user and/or between the mappings of a system and/or between the mappings of one system to another or more, may be enhanced, extended, or expanded on in loaded modules and definitions of the system or device, the user may only be on one mapping at a time, mappings perform the ...

Hangup... System Command with the user, which has exited and left the mapping, in question as a parameter, relative to the user and the mapping(s), system(s), device(s), traveled from, as necessary when changing between mappings, systems, devices, to accomplish such, though if the mapping represents a physical area, the virtual areas are preferred and privacy for nonvirtual areas is within authorization, authorization level, permissions, consent, and current location and location status information sharing, given to the user, but if such isn’t an option, such as an augmented zone, the user isn’t forced to leave the physical area the is at, and, or, travel to another physical area, though if the mapping the user wants to travel to represents a physical area, the user is notified the user isn’t at the physical area of the mapping the user wants to travel to, and won’t be able to change to being on the network of the specific mapping which represents the physical area the user isn’t aren’t at until such a time, if safe to do so and perform(s) the ... Hangup... System Command at the best time from when the user to drive, to intends to use their GPS if GPS use will be affected by the contact by the system, and, or, mapping, and, or, collection, and, or, endpoint, or waepoint, if safe to do so, and if unsafe to do, at the first safe opportunity while the user is driving, if such an opportunity presents during the timespan, and the system, and, or, mapping, and, or, collection, and, or, endpoint, or waepoint, they were contacted by contacts again, if they get in an accident while driving the specific trip, if they will be helped by the system, and, or, mapping, and, or, collection, and, or, endpoint, or waepoint, the specific contacting to remedy an injury incurred if an injury occurs from the accident by the contact, one time per time such happens if such happens
**Inheriting**, referring to the definition of the system or or segment or mapping or device of a system in the definition of the system of the system or a device or segment or mapping or device, within or out of the system stack, but within the network of the endpoint
**Managing Entity**, the entity, or entities, which the inheriting or contained or stacked on system is inheriting or containing or stacked by from in the inheritance chain or in the series of scopes or in the system stack, respectively, in respect to the system
**Preferrings**, representations of how the user prefers to be interacted with tracked automatically by the system or by the user’s own self or other users and are changed naturally and only by the user’s own self through explicit and implicit or inherent or subconscious or semiconsciousconsideration and expression, never system commands
**Inventory**, where all module descriptions, and system speech which isn’t wanted to be applying is automatically kept when preferrings match or what’s being stacked is a module description, what’s in inventory is never tracking and is absent of application of effects applied from the system and by the system, module descriptions move themselves and are stored in the inventory every time they end up elsewhere, may however, be loaded and apply until discarded
**System Provisions**, the provisions and tracking modules descriptions which combine to produce the user experience and system specifics which are distinct from the Waepoint System Standards
**Hub Provisions**, hub provisions are the system provisions, for the hub, which are distinct from the Waepoint System Standards stacked on the hub’s zones and other mappings other than the lobby, the hub provisions, like the Waepoint System Standards, which are stacked on every mapping of the hub and on lobbies and every system which shares an identity with the Waepoint System Standards and stay in sync with the current version of the waepointstandards repository on GitHub.com’s current version of the main branch, as identified by the letter v, then a decimal number, in the README.md file in the Copyright section, aren’t able to be opted out of except in entirety, opting in is also in entirety, and without consenting to the most recent revision of the hub provisions when an addition to the hub provisions occurs, the user is limited to the lobbies and isn’t able to be taken to zones or other mappings except the being hung up lobby, and additions to the hub provisions take the users to the lobby until they consent to the most recent revision or perform or have performed on the them the hangup reserved defined system command, the Waepoint System Standards of the current version of the waepointstandards repository on GitHub.com current version of the main branch, as identified by the the letter v, then a decimal number, in the README.md file in the Copyright section is consented to by connecting to a system, an endpoint or waepoint or lobby or hub or through an imbuing or through a extended to device by a system or other device which shares an identity with the Waepoint System Standards, though the Waepoint System Standards may be opted out of, but only in entirety, opting out performs the hangup reserved defined system command and prevents future contacting with a hub or lobby until such a time if such a time comes where the user which opted out, opts in, and consents to the Waepoint System Standards
**User**, is provisioned as an entity interacting with the endpoint or waepoint or system or an application of the effects applicable relevant to the endpoint or waepoint or system’s users, the default role and constant role of the endpoint or waepoint or system’s population beyond the owner of the endpoint, in interactions through an endpoint or waepoint or system’s, we understand each other in our native language when interacting through an endpoint or waepoint or system
**Owner**, the owner of the endpoint, waepoint, or system, without an administrator role, may stack or approve the stacking or tracking or unstacking or changing or stopping tracking of a definition of the equal tier, which they are an owner, or managing entity, of, in the definition hierarchy downwards on the hierarchy for themselves or others, owners receive the incoming connection and joining requests, and set the access policy of the system(s), endpoint(s), waepoint(s) they are the owner of, or if are the owner of the endpoint, or waepoint, the system is on, or the system’s, endpoint’s, waepoint’s access policy and add a user to a segment, change users belonging to’s segment to another segment, or to cancel the segment(s)
**Administrator**, initially the owner of the endpoint, system, or waepoint, administrators may pass on the system, or endpoint, or waepoint, administrator role and may designate system moderators, and other roles, if the role is described by system provisions of the system the administrator is an administrator of, or a top-level provision of the endpoint, or waepoint, the administrator is the administrator of, but only an owner of the endpoint, or waepoint, or system, may designate a new amount of system, or endpoint, or waepoint, administrators, or undesignate system, or endpoint, or waepoint, administrators, is the only role which may stack, change and unstack, or approve the act of stacking, tracking, changing or unstacking, stopping tracking of a definition of the endpoint, waepoint, or system, and the access policy of the system, or endpoint, or waepoint, of whichever the system, or endpoint, or waepoint, administrator holds a system, or endpoint, or waepoint, administrator role on, and may stack or approve the stacking of a definition of the equal tier to what they are the owner of, which they are an owner, or managing entity, of, in the definition hierarchy downwards on the hierarchy for themselves or others, and may do so with the system provisions, of the system(s) the administrator is an administrator of, and hub provisions the administrator is are an administrator of, and may perform any system command involving interactions which free, unstack, stop tracking, or clear, on any system speech, and on any system command speech, which wouldn’t be transferred through securelinking with the endpoint, or waepoint, and, or, system, on, through, or referencing, the system, endpoint, or waepoint, the administrator is an administrator of, for the system speech and system command speech of the user(s) holding a role of administrator, or lower, on the role hierarchy, and may change which users belong to any segment of the endpoint, or waepoint, the administrator is an administrator of if the administrator is an administrator of an endpoint, or waepoint, though are able to add segments without approval by the owner, or administrator, roles of the endpoint, or waepoint, if the administrator is an administrator role of the endpoint, or waepoint the administrator is adding the segment(s) to
**Moderator**, initially the administrator of the hub, system, endpoint or waepoint, moderators may pass on the moderator role, but only an administrator of the hub, or system, or  endpoint or waepoint, or an owner of the endpoint, or waepoint, or system, or hub, may designate a new amount of moderators and undesignate moderators, moderators can be stacked on ways, which are limited to tracking only for the user(s) of the mapping they are on, at any given time, and can’t be unstacked, or stacked on ways, which are limited to only tracking for the user(s) of the mapping the moderator is on, at any given time, by users, or other roles, other than administrator(s), and moderator(s), additionally, moderators receive the general incoming connection and joining request(s) when connected to the system stack of the system, and, or, endpoint, or waepoint, they are a moderator of, also, may free any system speech and, or, system command speech, which wouldn’t be transferred through securelinking with the endpoint, or waepoint, or system, of a user with a role below moderator of the system, hub, endpoint or waepoint within the moderator’s role’s responsible scope
**Endpoint**, hardware/software which is the standalone compatible, and which is stacked on a definition of the endpoint involving the Waepoint System Standards, terminus network node(s), which is capable of setting up compatible devices as inheriting waepoints, and which is compatible with extending to compatible devices by the Waepoint System Standards’s Extending provision’s description of extending and is connected and part of the network with and without the use of the Waepoint System Standards, and, or, what the repository describes as imbuing, owner and administrator roles of the endpoint are permitted to change a definition of the endpoint and provisions of the endpoint and are designated the same role on the systems of the endpoint, an endpoint isn’t able to be referred to by other than the owners or administrators of the endpoint, the governing entities, and users they still approve of doing so, if the reference will have an interaction or multiple interactions from or with or by or involving the endpoint, inherited references created through the Setup... Phone/Device As A Waepoint/Lobby? reserved defined system commands are allowed but aren’t to be edited or adjusted, only unstacked, by users, an endpoint can only be stacked on, or be unstacked, by an owner of the endpoint or an administrator of the endpoint, for connections outside stacked systems, users of an endpoint while on a mapping outside of the system(s) of the endpoint are allowed to perform utility, communication, connection, and transportation, reserved defined system commands, in user verbal and gestural system command interactions, and are allowed free roam of the systems, mappings, and collections of the endpoint they meet the access criteria for and the provisions from the communityprovisions.md, micro.md standards.md, README.md, and mini.md, from the waepointstandards repository on GitHub.com’s main branch, the current version, when the user isn’t on a mapping of a hub, attempts initiated for unstacking, unstack the unstacked system speech to the lowest latency hub’s library which is in-network with a good amount of more than enough storage available for shelving the system speech unstacked by the unstacking, users may free roam to the mapping(s) and system(s) of an endpoint and the joined collections and joined mappings and joined systems joined with the collections, mappings, and systems of the endpoint when they’re on an endpoint or a system stacked on a system or the endpoint, each endpoint has an endpoint lobby
**The Grand Lobby**, each lobby may join with the grand lobby, which is the largest scale shared lobby of all the lobbies, joining with another lobby on the grand lobby, leaves the grand lobby and joins with the other lobby in a shared lobby, the grand lobby performs the reserved hangup system command on the deceased, and unconscious, or sleeping, go to their respective plateau, users aren’t able to initiate First Aid System Commands or tracking healing on the grand lobby or set the grand lobby to initiate first aid system commands or tracking healing
**Independent Lobby**, a variant of independent system setup with a properly inheriting definition of the lobby from a system or system stacked on or independent of the endpoint or waepoint, has a persistent shared lobby which grows with the users every joined system, and are created when systems join between the systems, if the lobby is stacked on a waepoint or endpoint with a hub, the imbuing is tracked by the endpoint the lobby was imbued on, keeping the owners and administrators of the endpoint as the owners of the lobby in addition to any designated owner of the lobby by an owner of where the object was imbued, but assigning an owner of the lobby to the user which does the imbuing, shares what is considered the hub by the endpoint the lobby was imbued on unless otherwise stated, lobbies may only be stacked by the Setup... As An Independent Lobby reserved defined system command, and lobbies may be temporarily cancelled or cancelled when and while the owning, governing and managing entities want the lobbies temporarily cancelled or cancelled, when the user isn’t on a mapping of a hub, attempts initiated for unstacking, unstack the unstacked system speech to the lowest latency hub’s library which is in-network with a good amount of more than enough storage available for shelving the system speech unstacked by the unstacking
**Joining**, the linking of compatible systems, compatible mappings, compatible collections which create a shared lobby between the compatible systems and, or, compatible collections, and, or,

**Confirmation**, the phrase and confirm when added to the end of a phrase of the user’s by the user’s self, confirms the phrase, and the additional custom confirmation(s) when added to the end of a phrase of the user’s by the user’s self, confirm the phrase
**Messaging Confirmation**, send, and confirm sends the message just detailed in a send a message… or reply with… communication system command, but only when intended to do so
**System Command Confirmation**, the phrases with a system command or as a system command, when added to the end of a phrase of the user’s by the user’s self, and the additional custom system command confirmation(s) also when added to the end of a phrase of the user’s by the user’s self, perform the phrase as a system command if the phrase matches with a system command, but only when intended to do so, if multiple system commands are mentioned and intended, the mentioned system command or system commands are performed with the phrases rephrased properly and perfectly for the intention and for the system command or system commands, as long as the phrase mentioned and system command share enough of a matching intention to the definition of the system command, and the user notices if the phrase doesn’t
**Abandon**, a word that abandons the system command from applying as a system command being initiated if in a system command, confirmed phrase from confirming, and stops the tracking, and prevents the stacking, of the phrases containing the abandon, the initial abandon is Abandon, and abandon
**Shelving**, shelved system speech in libraries doesn’t have effects applied in interactions between the user and other users or the user or other role’s self while shelved and the user is on a mapping until stacked again on the user which takes the system speech off the shelf by stacking the system speech on the user if a user or other role’s self chooses to do so, and a shelved user skips interacting with the hub beyond the hangup reserved defined system command or deshelving by a user self
**Changelog**, a user’s past changes and other user’s changes for the user are automatically stacked, and stopped tracking whenever the change doesn’t apply anymore, and may be unstacked, stopped tracking, or cleared, by the user, in a specific set, called a changelog, separate from the rest of a user’s commands and comments which are linked to the other user’s intention and unstack, untrack, and clear when the intention is unstacked, stopped tracking or cleared, but the comments may also be unstacked by a user for the application of effects applied respective to them

contingent on if they actually and really would be transferred through securelinking to a new device which meets the requisite specifications and authorizations and permissions without any user having asserted as such through system speech and mentioning and documenting outside of the Waepoint System Standards’s documentation

System command is used two consecutive times on by one of the listed options for doing so to free secured system speech and, or, system command speech, which would be transferred through securelinking, again by the system automatically afterwards unless secured afterwards by a user
**Locking**, securing system speech, mapping, or a system to enable the free… system command to cease the being locked and secured by performing the free… system command with a password or passkey or through micro.md by a user which wouldn’t normally have the authorization to do so with the system speech, mapping, or system which is locked, or user which did the locking, the user can always free any system speech secured on the user or the user’s property or relevant to the user or the user’s property which isn’t secured on a mapping, unless tracking outside of the mapping, then the system speech may be freed by the user, when freeing locked system speech without doing so through micro.md by a user of proper authorization level such as the owner of the system where the system speech or system was locked, or user which did the locking, or without the password or passkey, the user doing the freeing, if has proper authorization to, is prompted through noticing for approval to free the locked system speech and does so if they approve directly after the prompt, regardless of which user locked the system speech, even without the password or passkey, or may through micro.md
**Warding**, declining new system speech being stacked on the user’s property or the user, also the user or user’s property isn’t able to be referenced in new system speech or new system commands except first aid system commands and the hangup reserved defined system command and the free... system command by other than the user and may be freed with the free… reserved defined system command which ceases the warding, the user can always free any warding on the user or relevant to the user, even secured or locked warding, regardless of who warded the user

**Stacking**, having a(n) identity sharing, extends/extending, quality, function, any number of the listed options, reference or referencing as a definition, or as definitions, between a compatible device or endpoint or waepoint or segment or system or user or file or subject or object or personal property, and other or others, which aren’t having a identity sharing, extends/extending, quality, function, any number of the listed options, reference or referencing between anymore when being unstacked or cleared or when clearing or if clearing the representation of the types of definitions which do have the same qualities and/or system speech, or stopping the tracking of that type of definition, and/or the system speech, and after, also when adjusting from, stacked, safely saving believed and that the interacting user is or interacting users are believing system speech with a representation of the intention, saved, in invisible files inaccessible to all but the network and networked devices and compatibles involved which should have access for perfect security of the network and devices and the saved file’s data encoded with the right codec for the majority of the network’s previous use in recent years without the manipulation of events through system speech, by the system in the system for the system speech, organic matter and/or the subjects and/or the object

by the compatible system and/or compatible device and/or compatible devices and/or compatible software, or any or all of the options listed, when stacking or tracking, but when tracking, the tracking data for the tracking system speech and/or system command speech is stored, or cached in the computer’s RAM, or device’s preferred data caching, and what’s stacked on a user, or the mapping a user is on, interacts with the user while in the mapping which the mapping’s, system, or hub, or top-level, provisions, the provisions of the system speech’s category, and preferrings of the interacting users, for system speech of system speech categories which are prioritized below preferrings, permit, interacting how the stacked system speech is permitted to through the mapping’s provisions, and hub, or system, or top-level, provisions, the provisions of the Waepoint System Standards, also the definitions, and, if the system speech category of the system speech is prioritized below preferrings, preferrings, taking in account the intention on the system speech, and tracking in application of effects applied in interactions of the user perfectly for the intention on the system speech’s exact contextual applications, system speech stacked on the user has application of effects applied in the interactions of the user’s self, with the user’s self, and stays limited to the user in interactions with other users, system speech can be stacked by performing the defined system commands which do so, but, stacking may only be, by the user’s self, and, or, by the system automatically, for system speech which is stacked on the user’s self, or the user’s property and, or, possessions, and stacking may only be done so intentionally, or on a mapping, system, endpoint, or waepoint, if the mapping’s provisions, and hub provisions or system provisions, and top-level provisions, and the definitions, permit, and isn’t allowed to be contrary to the waepointstandards repository’s main branch’s micro.md, standards.md, README.md, and mini.md, and communityprovisions.md’s on GitHub.com’s files’ contents from the current version of the repository, without expansion, redaction or alteration, to the Waepoint System Standards, through system speech which is stacked, and, or, tracking, as an option, on an object as an imbuing, the stacked system speech isn’t allowed to be manufacturer, regulating agency, contractual obligation, licensing, publisher, owning entity, managing entity disapproved of in how the stacked system speech is interacting with the user, or the object, and is only able to be stacked on a piece of property which is the user’s own property unless the application of effects applicable relevant to the object is consented to still with informed consent by the piece of property’s owner, or by a parent, legal guardian, either, of a owner and the owner is under 18 or by the user for the owner for which the user has the power of attorney of, or is in the conservatorship of, or has spousal rights to and the owner is deceased or unconscious, the user unstacks on the stacked on the user system speech when the user dies or is rendered unconscious, if, and when, is safe, legal, and will be healthily interacting to unstack the particular system speech, independently and respectively amongst the system speech stacked on the user, if, and while, the user is dead or rendered unconscious, and when system speech is unstacked while the user isn’t on a mapping of a hub, or the system speech is unstacked through an independent system, imbuing, or extended to device, the system speech goes to the lowest latency hub’s library within the network, or inheritance chain, when unstacking system speech, what’s extended to by the stacked system speech still, stops being extended to
**Tracking**, the application of effects applicable which are applying, and interacting, at the current moment, in the interactions of the user, and also the interactions of the user with users on and off the mapping the user is on, and application of effects applicable applying in interactions of the user, if and when applicable, if an opportunity presents to apply, and if will be legal to apply in the ways which the specific application of effects applicable are to be applying, when applying, and with applying specifically to the involved, perfectly for the intention on the system speech’s, and, or, system command speech’s, exact contextual applications, with the application of effects applicable applying as the system speech interacting permits for system speech, to be stacked, or otherwise, and tracking, or otherwise, and the system command speech, to be tracking, or otherwise, and the specific application of effects applicable from the system speech, and, or, system command speech, when, and where, and to whomever, the effects are applicable and permitted to be applying, within the scope(s) applicable, and involved, and permitted to be involved, application of effects applicable in interactions with others interacting with a user within the proper scope(s) of the user’s currently interacting scope(s), and the user’s self interacting with the user’s self through the stacked system(s), and endpoint(s), and waepoint(s), and independent system(s), involved, and with the system speech, and, or, system command speech tracking for the user, and definitions of, and stacked on through intentional system command speech, the mapping, and, or, system, and, or, endpoint, and, or, waepoint, and, or, user, which has stacked within the specific segment the user belongs to, the mapping the user is on, individually and respectively, with the specific application of effects applicable from system speech, and, or, system command speech, staying individual and respective, and applicable for others which would be, and which are, affected when application of effects applicable isn’t unlawful still, and must stay within the limits of governmental regulation, and and isn’t allowed to be contrary to the waepointstandards repository’s main branch’s micro.md, standards.md and communityprovisions.md’s on GitHub.com’s files’ contents from the current version of the repository, without expansion, redaction, and/or alteration, through system speech which is tracking, when referencing the repository without referencing a specific branch, the main branch is referenced, and also for others also which consent still to the specific application of effects applicable applying to them relevant, even generally, and for whomever interacting with the specific application of effects applicable’s application of effects applied and the specific effects which are applied must be kept to within what makes for all involved with the the specific application of effects applicable applying so that each of the interacting whomever isn’t unlawful to have the specific application of effects applicable which are applying to themselves and the affected interactions of theirs, and the affected by their application of effects applicable which are applying to others than themselves, and if the specific application of effects applicable applying is intended to specifically involve the property and, or, a possession, of a user, the interacting application of effects applicable aren’t allowed to be manufacturer, regulating agency, contractual obligation, licensing, publisher, published policy, and, or, owning entity, and, or, managing entity, disapproved of, and, or, injurious, and, or, unlawful,  and, or, unsafe, system speech, and, or, system command speech, while interacting with the system, application of effects applied avoids enhancing, and, or, limiting in such a way as to be hindering of the conscious independence of a user, and, or, the limit the ability to communicate independently and to do so without alteration from the intended independently generated intent for the user’s own communication being the message communicated through whichever medium the message is communicated, the system translates the message seamlessly and authentically to any other language’s vocabulary words and phrases the user has heard before when intended to be speaking in the language, whenever translation is intended independently by myself for the message, keeping the intention for the entire message equivalent between the languages before, during and after the translation, already dangerous things aren’t able to be made more dangerous through the system, past events aren’t changeable by the system speech and also by system command speech, and anchors aren’t able to be can’t have happened and, or, adjusted retroactively, if the anchor is essential to the survival of a user, and, or users in multiple, instead, when changing the past would happen if a system command is successful, the user won’t be allowed to change to the past event(s), the associated system command stops tracking, and the  independent system, or endpoint, or waepoint, the system command was performed on, lets the user, which performed the system command in question, notice the past isn’t allowed to be changed, barring governing entity restriction, and, or, approval, of the necessary and proper authorization(s), authorization level(s), and role(s)
**Mappings**, the travelable area, of the network(s) of the connected user(s), which are stacked on the endpoint(s), waepoint(s), and, or, independent system(s), and, or, stacked system(s), users may change mappings through travel and mappings are travelable to and from
**Relaypoint**, any attached resource or attached relaypoint or resource which has a direct route by way of network connectivity to the endpoint and associated backend
**Resource**, any device in the network which has been attached which adds to the local and overall availability of memory, storage, network connectivity, computational ability, modes of interactivity, modes of interfacing or power for the hub
**Clustering**, adding new resources for a hub by attaching to devices, and endpoints and network lobbies send their network activity through the nearest network lobby, Route attaching happens when you attach a device which has network connectivity access and cloud attaching is the act of attaching any additional devices and adding to the resources for the hub, attaching devices with network connectivity allows for more routes to the endpoint and associated backend, each attaching increases the resources available, memory, storage, or network connectivity, computational ability, modes of interfacing, modes of interactivity and power, allows for an increase of available resources locally and overall, making available a lot of local resources makes for higher and enhanced capability and in some cases capacity available in the area and to the hub
**Extending**, extend the hub through devices or software allowing for new functionality of the hub, and extends to every mode of interfacing with the device as hub interfaces when interacting with a user through the hub
**Scope** the limits of what’s affected in an interaction, may be phrase-level, user-level, mapping-level, system-level, collection-level, segment-level, device-level, cross-device level, users-level

## System Mappings

**Zone**, a network of users which permits stacking of ways and tenets on the zone, and may have the application of effects applied from ways and tenets and reserved or hub provisioned or zone bound or user defined system commands and the stacked system speech in the interactions between users and the users or other users in the same zone, users return to the lobby if in a zone or other mapping other than the lobby of the hub at the time of more recent revision of the hub’s provisions than the most recent consent is for relevant to the specific provision changes to the hub’s provisions, when changing the ways and/or tenets a of a zone away from the initial ways and tenets, the hub asks the user to name the zone by prompting them to notice a request to do so or abandon the way and/or tenet change and acts on the response, named zones are called stops, stops can be partitioned into more stops, each contained stop inheriting the ways and tenets of the containing stops, zones let the user hear the voices on the zone, but within the limits of the system’s provisions and provisions of the Waypoint System Standards and definitions of the zone and/or the definitions of the system provisions
**Lobby**, a network in which the application of effects applied in the interactions with the user(s) by the system(s) and between the users, when and while they are interacting through the lobby and the users are, or user is, on the lobby, stay well within a comfortable range, is only the definition of the system without adding system provisions beyond the Waepoint System Standards, without expansion, alteration or redaction, and lobby-bound and lobby available system commands and declaring system commands which don’t involve interactions and/or system speech which harms or heals or is about either, administrative system commands, utility system commands, transportation system commands, the initial consent system commands, connection system commands, the clean uninstall the repository... System Command, the request… system command from the Lobby-Bound Reserved Defined System Commands, and the related gestures if a gesture related is in the provisions of the system, and system command confirmations, the users which have yet to consent to the most recent revision are limited in terms of mappings to be taken to to the lobbies and if a user is taken to the lobby by a version change of the system provisions, the user notices they were taken to the lobby because of a system provision change, also if they connect to the system and haven’t consented to the most recent revision of the system provisions they notice, ways aren’t permitted to be stacked on a lobby and the on a moderator stacked ways are suspended while in the lobby, accepted incoming connection requests are taken to the lobby when entering the system, lobbies let the user hear the voices on the lobby, but within the limits of the provisions of the Waypoint System Standards, modules aren’t able to apply to and, or, on lobbies
**Library**, the zone where unstacked, stacked system speech gets shelved in the respective library for safe keeping and keeping safe from, without application of effects applied in interactions with the system speech shelved, while shelved, until the system speech is stacked again or deshelved, and to be shelved, as a user or other role, being shelved lets the user notice the user’s been shelved and needs to deshelve or hangup and skips interacting with the other mappings of the hub beyond the send a message… and reply with… reserved defined system commands or deshelving by a user and the user is unstacked on the user’s stacked system speech, additionally, the users in the library interacting with the user and the users don’t have application of effects applied from the user’s in the library’s stacked system speech in interactions with the user by the user and other users in the library while in the library
**Plateau**, the users’ family within a generation’s, for the user(s) under 18 and the user(s) which have a user, or have users, under 18 as children, and, or, of which the user is the legal guardian of, otherwise, the user’s, individual and respective or segment’s outermost and initial area as a travelable representation of the user’s family within a generation’s, for the user(s) under 18 and the user(s) which have a user, or have users, under 18 as children, and, or, of which the user is the legal guardian of, otherwise, the user’s, collection or the segment’s communal between users in the segment’s collection in the each segment they belong to, untravelable to by user(s) which aren’t the user’s family within a generation’s, for the user(s) under 18 and the user(s) which have a user, or have users, under 18 as children, and, or, of which the user is the legal guardian of, otherwise, the user’s, selfs, if the user’s family within a generation’s, for the user(s) under 18 and the user(s) which have a user, or have users, under 18 as children, and, or, of which the user is the legal guardian of, otherwise, the user’s, individual plateau, and, or, the stacked on successive system(s) and, or, collections, of, is the, outside of the user’s family within a generation, for the user(s) under 18 and the user(s) which have a user, or have users, under 18 as children, and, or, of which the user is the legal guardian of, otherwise, other than the user’s self’s, user’s destination, every plateau comes with a lobby, and each plateau offers users only lobby available system commands in terms of available system commands, the deceased have the hangup reserved defined system command performed on them when on the deceased’s respective plateau after a few hours

## Reserved Defined System Command Gestures

> All system command gestures don’t interact with any to all secured by the system(s) automatically and/or through securelinking

### Focusing Gestures

**Focus Gesture:** The user tapping their second knuckle back from the tip of the user’s forefinger with the user’s thumb tip one time, focus on, if a defined system gesture was performed by the user within the past couple of seconds, the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command gesture, otherwise, defines system speech, of the appropriate system speech category and contents, referred to as the focus of the user’s most recent defined system command, which is the representation of the user’s most recent focused intention before the user performed the focus gesture, until user performs another focus gesture or a few seconds go by without performing a defined system command
**Sustained Focus Gesture:** The user holding their second knuckle back from the tip of the user’s forefinger to the user’s thumb tip focuses on, as system speech of the appropriate system speech category and contents, which is the representation of what the intent intended of the user, for the user’s system speech focused on and intended at the time of initiating the gesture and while the user is doing the sustained focus gesture that time, which is referred to after as the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command gesture

**Apply Gesture:** The user placing their thumb between their forefinger and their middle finger applies the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command as a defined system command, and only if is an already defined system command, if the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command the user has performed is a system command, either a reserved defined system command or a defined system command gesture by the user already, the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command gesture made by the user within the past couple of seconds, skipping stopping tracking and/or unstacking and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, of any and all secured by the system(s) automatically and through securelinking, unless authorized to do so, also all system speech which is essential to the manufacturer’s, also system speech and system command speech referenced and, or, which would be stopped tracking and, or, unstacked, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, by the system command given which is wanted by the user unless specifically unstacked and, or, stopped tracking, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, for system speech and system command speech which is pertinent to the, expected operation of the device(s) involved with the specific performing of the system command which is being given when the system command is performed, each time the system command is performed, and system speech and system command speech unrelated to the usage of the waepointstandards git repository unless specifically intended and safe and isn’t unhealthy to unstack and, or, stop tracking, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, and any and all secured, warded, locked, and, or, anchored, and can’t be used to jeopardize the safety, and or or health, of another user, and or or, the user’s self, and stays within the limits of authorization(s), and authorization level(s), role(s), and permission(s) which have been granted, consent given, to the user
**While Gesture:** The user placing their thumb on the farthest knuckle of the user’s forefinger from the tip applies the focused on intention of the user as a system command the user while is making the while gesture, skipping  stopping tracking and/or unstacking and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, of any and all secured by the system(s) automatically and through securelinking, unless authorized to do so, also all system speech which is essential to the manufacturer’s, also system speech and system command speech referenced and, or, which would be stopped tracking and, or, unstacked, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, by the system command given which is wanted by the user unless specifically unstacked and, or, stopped tracking, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, for system speech and system command speech which is pertinent to the, expected operation of the device(s) involved with the specific performing of the system command which is being given when the system command is performed, each time the system command is performed, and system speech and system command speech unrelated to the usage of the waepointstandards git repository unless specifically intended and safe and isn’t unhealthy to unstack and, or, stop tracking, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, and any and all secured, warded, locked, and, or, anchored, and can’t be used to jeopardize the safety, and or or health, of another user, and or or, the user’s self, and stays within the limits of authorization(s), and authorization level, role(s) and permission(s) which have been granted, consent given, to the user

### Stacking and Unstacking Gestures

**Stack Gesture:** The user holding the tip of the user’s forefinger with the user’s thumb tip for a couple seconds stacks on the user the system speech or the mentioned mapping if permitting on the system speech referenced while making the stack gesture, or in the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command gesture, as the appropriate system system speech category, and can’t be used to jeopardize the safety, and or or health, of another user, and or or, the user’s self
**Unstack/Stop Tracking Gesture:**  Hold for a few seconds,  the user’s thumb tip to user’s middle fingertip to unstack, if stacked the system speech is, the system speech stacked which is the system command speech focus, if tracking the system speech and/or the system command speech is, and stop tracking the system speech and system command speech which is the system command speech focus, or if either or both and referenced for either and both cases, in the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system gesture within the past couple of seconds in the safest, most harmless, most helpful order and way, and can’t be used on tracking first aid system command and tracking healing results after completion of a first aid system command or a tracking healing act, can’t be used to jeopardize the safety, and or or health, of another user, and or or, the user’s self, skipping stopping tracking and/or unstacking and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, of any and all secured by the system(s) automatically and through securelinking, also all system speech which is essential to the manufacturer’s, also system speech and system command speech referenced and, or, which would be stopped tracking and, or, unstacked, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, by the system command given which is wanted by the user unless specifically unstacked and, or, stopped tracking, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, for system speech and system command speech which is pertinent to the, expected operation of the device(s) involved with the specific performing of the system command which is being given when the system command is performed, each time the system command is performed, and system speech and system command speech unrelated to the usage of the waepointstandards git repository unless specifically intended and safe and isn’t unhealthy to unstack and, or, stop tracking, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, and any and all secured, warded, locked, and, or, anchored, and can’t be used on tracking first aid system command and tracking healing results after completion of a first aid system command or a tracking healing act, and can’t be used to jeopardize the safety, and or or health, of another user, and or or, the user’s self, and stays within the limits of authorizations, and authorization level, and permissions which have been granted and role
**Info Unstack/Stop Tracking Gesture:** Hold for a few seconds, the user’s thumb tip to the user’s ring finger tip to unstack, or if the gesture is being performed by the user an even number of consecutive times, unstack, the user, or if more appropriate, mapping with the referenced system speech by the most recent info response stacked, and or or tracking, if stacked and or or tracking, whichever and or or both, whichever is most appropriate, on what the user communicates during the period between when the user starts performing the gesture to when the user pauses in their communication for at least a single second’s time, as system speech, if the user is performing the gesture an odd number of times consecutively, unstacks and, or, stops tracking the referenced system speech and referenced system command speech in the info gesture or ask... Reserved Defined System Command’s response on the user, or if more appropriate, mapping with the referenced system speech by the most recent info response stacked, if the user’s thumb tip is held to the user’s ring finger tip for a couple of seconds at least, skipping stopping tracking and/or unstacking and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, of any and all secured by the system(s) automatically and through securelinking, also all system speech which is essential to the manufacturer’s, also system speech and system command speech referenced and, or, which would be stopped tracking and, or, unstacked, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, by the system command given which is wanted by the user unless specifically unstacked and, or, stopped tracking, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, for system speech and system command speech which is pertinent to the, expected operation of the device(s) involved with the specific performing of the system command which is being given when the system command is performed, each time the system command is performed, and system speech and system command speech unrelated to the usage of the waepointstandards git repository unless specifically intended and safe and isn’t unhealthy to unstack and, or, stop tracking, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, and any and all secured, warded, locked, and, or, anchored, and can’t be used on tracking first aid system command and tracking healing results after completion of a first aid system command or a tracking healing act, and can’t be used to jeopardize the safety, and or or health, of another user, and or or, the user’s self, and stays within the limits of authorizations, and authorization level, and permissions which have been granted, consent given to the user and role

### Utility System Command Gestures

**Define System Command Gesture:** The user makes a G by holding out their index finger and placing the user’s thumb on their top of closed middle, ring, and pinky fingers to define a system command or system command gesture, to apply the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command gesture, which the user may communicate to the system at a later time

**Info Gesture:** Touch the thumb tip to the tip of the pinky to ask questions of the system about the system’s status and receive information from the system about the query with the user’s self noticing the response, within the limits of the user’s authorizations, authorization level, role, and permissions, and within the queried of’s authorizations, permissions, protected privacy, authorization level, and role, additional application of effects applied, don’t come from asking a question to the info gesture

## Reserved Defined System Commands

> All system commands don’t interact with any to all secured by the system(s) automatically and/or through securelinking

### Initial Consent System Commands

**...consent/consents/consenting/consented to the most recent revision…**, is the exact phrase that must be said to stop being limited to the ask... System Command, and transportation system commands, initial consent system commands, and the ... Hangup... and ... Leave... Reserved Defined System Commands, which both of are made available to the user(s) in their interactions with the compatible devices and an instance, or instances, of the standardized Standard Definition described in the first quote in the README.md file, specifically, the Standard Definition of Interactions with the Compatible Device(s), from the standardized Waepoint System Standards version’s README.md file’s contents, also described in the License section of the README.md file’s, README.md file’s contents, or the endpoint, the waepoint, the independent system, system, interacting with the user, if wouldn’t be available otherwise, and the lobbies, and the segment plateau, and the plateau specific to the user, in the segment(s) of the device(s) the user may travel to a mapping of, and is considered to be consent given for the use of the travelable system, and mapping, being attempt initiated to be travelled to’s, or a system which a user or the system initiated an attempt to interact with the user system’s, or a system the user is attempting to interact with’s system provisions’ latest revision by other than the user’s self in entirety, specifically the relevant, system provisions, or, hub provisions, which weren’t made by the user’s self, of the system, or hub, changed since prior consent was given for a version of the system intended’s system provisions if prior consent has been given relevant to the system intended’s system provisions, and, or, hub’s hub provisions, specifically, the relevant hub, or system, provisions which weren’t made by the user’s self, and is always given as a system command, even without giving a system command and may be only given from a user’s self for the user’s self or by a parent, legal guardian, either, for a user and the user is under 18 or by a user for which the user has the power of attorney of and, or, is in conservatorship of and, or, has spousal rights to, the user, and the user is deceased or unconscious

### Consent System Commands

**Opt me… in/I agree and consent**, if in response to the intended offer for an application of effects applicable intended, by the offerer to the most relevant person(s) to the offered intended application of effects applicable intended, if the user which is being offered the application of effects applicable agrees to the application of effects applicable and has informed consent of the application of effects applicable, or abandoning the initiating of the system command’s attempt initiated otherwise, to have application of the system’s effects applied will have the system consider consent is given without having to give a confirmation, or, a system command confirmation, for the responded to intended offer for an application of effects applicable intended, either performing the defined system commands within the offer responded to, defining the definitions in the offer responded to, or, confirming the phrase which is the offer responded to, whichever is best, safest, healthiest, and legal, with the handling of each within the limitations of, and with the allowances of, the correlating provisions of the Waepoint System Standards
**Opt in to.../opt back in to.../I consent to…**, followed by something you have revoked consent to or can consent to in regards to the application of a specific set of effects applicable, will have the system consider consent is given for the application of a specific set of effects applicable, consent can only be given by a user’s self or a parent, legal guardian, either, of the user which is a user under 18 or a user for which the user has the power of attorney of or is in conservatorship of or has spousal rights to and the user is deceased or unconscious regarding the application of a specific set of effects applicable which may be applied in the future
**Opt out of.../Opt me out of.../I revoke prior consent for…**, followed by something you have, or can consent to regarding the system which is less in the system priorities hierarchy than a provision, will revoke prior consent given by a user’s self or a parent, legal guardian, either, of the user which is a user under 18 or a user for which the user has the power of attorney of or is in conservatorship of or has spousal rights to and the user is deceased or unconscious regarding the application of a specific set of effects applicable which may be applied in the future, to opt out of the Waepoint System Standards and/or a provision of communityprovision.md and/or definition in micro.md is to opt out of the Waepoint System Standards in entirety

### Communication System Commands

> Thinking the phrases send a message to…, replay the last message…, set my messaging confirmation… or reply with… if the user will give the reserved defined system command through the hub for each of the appropriate context is met and the send a message provision of the hub, has been consented to in any current or previous form whether connected or disconnected from the hub, the default messaging confirmation is Send

> Receiving messages is restricted to users whose preferrings allow for receiving messages and receiving the message in specific

**Send a message to…**, and a description, name, either, of a user on or off the hub which has consented before to the send a message provision, and a message to send which ends in send and a second or more of a pause lets the receiving user or other role’s self of the message’s self notice a message has been received sent by the sending user’s first name and last initial and the timestamp down to the minute of when the message was sent as soon as is safe and practical and acceptably private for the recipient by the recipient’s standards and expectations for the notification of the receipt of the message and the message sent, if the message doesn’t end in the user’s abandon, or the recipient isn’t a consented recipient and then the user notices that, the message also isn’t sent if the message sending device is mentioned to be an implanted device in the system command
**Replay the last message…**, when given as a system command, lets the user notice the most recent message received complete with first name and last initial of the sender and timestamp down to the the minute of when the message was sent
**Reply with…**, and a message to reply with ending in send and a second or more of a pause after receiving a message sent through the system but thinking of either an aspect of the message or the person, sends a message to the sending user of the message received’s own self in the same way as the send a message to system command but with an updated timestamp for the reply’s sent time, but doesn’t send the message if the message ends in the user’s abandon, also doesn’t send the message if the message sending device is mentioned to be an implanted device in the system command
**Conference call with…**, sends a request to start a remote conversation with the users or users described in the phrase and requests of them to participate in a conference call with the requesting user’s first name, last initial, and current location’s municipality, informing them the first time they do a conference call, the requested user will be extending the system to their vocal chords, tongue, mouth muscles and lips while the speaker is talking to reproduce the words and voice of the speaking participating users voices, but obeying the preferrings of the user relevant, but with only one being relayed at a time to the participant users or participant user which are the intended recipient or recipients of the speaking participating users’ or user’s words and voice, per which user is currently speaking and starting talking without a one second pause after starting most recently first in the other participants individual and respective voices relative to each user’s own body for the speaker’s voice but within the body’s own comfortable range and comfortable volume and comfortable intensity for vocal only communication which has been and is being relayed, but with the own body’s voice for the own body speaking, without causing harm to or unnecessary movement of one or more parts any participating users of the call is what they are informed of during the request for a first time conference call and that conference call which do have harm occur during the call don’t initiate requests, only the vocal communication which is intended to be relayed to the conference call or a participant user of the conference call is relayed and communication which is intended for specific participant users or a specific participant user is relayed to the specific participant user or specific participant users only, communication which would cause harm to a participating users isn’t relayed to the participant users and priority of movement of a participating user’s own body is never put after for another participating user during the duration of the conference call, but always come before during the duration of the conference call, any other participating user’s in terms of priority, with priority given to what comes before during the conference call, any movements which aren’t exactly necessary for the vocal only communication of a comfortably loud enough volume to be the usual speech volume of a user being communicated doesn’t get relayed to other participanting users, and all participating users don’t have haptic feedback or movement feedback or resistance to movement feedback from other participant’s movements and may only be done with users of the same species and/or other users which won’t be harmed or cause harm during the conference call, and the individual calls if a call was initiated for the participant user for the conference call are over when the conference call is said to be hung up and when a user says hang up or says something intending to leave the conference call at that time they hangup and the last user left in the conference call notices the conference call is over, the conference call is done with, and if the last user left in the conference call wasn’t on the system already performs the hangup reserved defined system command for the last user left in the conference call and all users which weren’t on the system or managing systems before the conference call which participated and any users which were brought onto the system for the conference call, and when hung up from the conference call the participating user which is hung up and the participating users which are hung up from the conference call cease having the participating user or participating users in the conference call which got hung up’s vocal chords, tongue, mouth muscles and lips extended to by the system

## Connection & Joining Requests

> Connection requests and, or, contact requests and, or, joining requests aren’t able to be made against the receiving user’s preferrings

Users on the compatible system or endpoint, or waepoint, which have the capability available may request the connection of another user, or joining of a compatible system or compatible collection or compatible mapping, if meeting the access policy, off the system if the requesting user owns, or is approved to still by the owner of, the system or endpoint or waepoint or compatible system or compatible mapping or compatible collection, or if the requesting user owns an endpoint or waepoint or compatible system or compatible mapping or compatible collection, or has been approved to still by the owner of the endpoint or waepoint or compatible system or compatible mapping or compatible collection, to join to a compatible system or compatible mapping or compatible collection owned by another user from the owning user or of a user which the owning user has approved still to approve joining requests, if the preferrings for both the requesting user and requested user, or users, and the owners of the systems or devices relevant’s allow for the request from the requesting user at the time of the request’s initiated attempt, the requested user notices when they have been requested to connect to the endpoint or waepoint or compatible system the requesting user’s on by noticing the requesting user’s first name and last initial and current municipality wants to connect, if connecting to a endpoint or waepoint or compatible system, or join, if joining a compatible system or compatible mapping or compatible collection, and if the requested user hasn’t connected or joined to a compatible system before, when notified of the request and accepting the request, notices that the interfacing guidelines at waepoints.com, double u ei eee points dot com, is used in the interactions of the user when and while connected and accepting the request is having informed consent to use the repository’s contents because the repository requires informed consent for accepting offers of application of effects applied to the user, also the requested user must be open and would want to join or connect to whichever the requesting user is asking for the joining or connecting at the time of the request, any affirmative response given as the first response at the time of the request’s noticing by the requested of user in reference to the connection request or joining request will let the requesting user connect or join to the requested compatible system or device, any disapproving response given as the first response at the time of the request in reference to the connection request or joining request will deny the connection or joining, accepting the connection request consents to the Waepoint System Standards’s repository’s main branch’s file contents for standards.md, micro.md, README.md, mini.md and communityprovisions.md, the current version, as does generating an incoming connection request or a joining request, and the hangup reserved defined system command is performed on users which do if the user of any role but owner of the endpoint initiates the planning or the act of a violent crime, without being able to cease the hangup reserved defined system command, and are without the application of effects applied and receiving or initiating connection requests during the act or planning of a violent crime, if an owner of the waepoint or lobby does while on the system, the system and stacked on systems perform the hangup... reserved defined system command, connection requests to unconscious or dead users which have a connection request initiated by a first aid system command automatically accept the first aid system command initiated connection request if there is a preferrings of the to be healed user’s that the unconscious or dead user would rather be healed than be dead or unconscious and match the owner of the system’s preferring, and if they don’t meet the access policy for the system, the being healed user has the hangup reserved defined system command performed on them when they are done healing, without being able to have other than hangup reserved defined system command interactions allowed by them or with them until they match the access policy or through preferring of the owner of the system, any user wanting to stop talking with the people they are, or has their owned, or has the approval of the owner of to, has the joined compatible system, joined compatible collection, joined compatible mapping, they’re on, perform the leave... Reserved defined system command on the joined compatible system, joined compatible collection, joined compatible mapping, they’re on, or has the hangup reserved defined system command performed on their active phone call with the system, or endpoint, or waepoint, or mapping, they’re on, and perfectly avoid receiving subsequent calls or connection attempt initiated until the user which got their call performing the hangup reserved defined system command has preferring match with wants to receive a call or start another connection request to a compatible system, endpoint, waepoint, they meet the access policy of which they preferred to have the hangup... Reserved defined system command performed on their active phone call with the system, or endpoint, or waepoint, or mapping, they were on, again

## Incoming Connection & Joining Requests

Incoming connection requests and incoming joining requests are only listened for when the owner or an approved user of the owner will connect or join, each time a device with a hub hasn’t had the owner or owners, a new owner or a newly approved user which may connect or join within a week, connect or join yet, the hub or other compatible system is listening for incoming connection or joining requests, and after that connection or joining, and the owner or user’s timeline is established, listening for inbound connections happens only when an owner or user will be joining or connecting, also the listening for inbound connection or joining requests may be status changed through system commands, and listens for inbound connection or joining requests again when there is a change to the established timeline of the owner or an approved user by the owner
Owners of the endpoints, waepoints, hubs, compatible systems, mappings, collections and independent lobbies, receive connection requests from the users which match the compatible destination’s access policy and from themselves when they are intending to connect to the compatible destination, and joining requests from owners of lobbies, compatible systems, hubs, collections, mappings, which intend to join with the compatible system, collection, hub or lobby, mapping, but lobbies can only join with lobbies, whether the lobby is independent of an endpoint or waepoint or stacked on, the incoming connection requests and joining requests, will go to the owners of the endpoint, or owners of the waepoint or owners of the hub or owners of the compatible system, owners of the collection, or owners of the lobby, and a specific owner of the endpoint or waepoint or hub or compatible system or compatible device or lobby can be requested of out of the owners by referencing the specific owner in the request, if a request is denied or declined, the owner notices they may send a message to the user which initiated the request to explain the decline until the phrase send and confirm or communicate the abandon and send nothing back or decline to send a message back, if the incoming connection or joining request is approved, the user is taken to the collection, or compatible system, and landing mapping, whichever the request was for, unless the request was for a lobby, then to the lobby, or hub if the request was for a hub, and if the incoming joining request is approved, the requested endpoint joins with the requesting endpoint or the requesting waepoint or the requested waepoint joins with the requesting waepoint or endpoint, or the requested hub joins with the requested hub, or the requested compatible system joins with the requested compatible system, or collection joins with the collection, or the mapping joins with the mapping, or the requesting lobby joins with the requested lobby, or whichever combination of the options requested is compatible, until either the leave... Or hangup... reserved defined system command is performed on either the requesting compatible system, collection, mapping, or requested compatible system, collection, mapping, by an owner of either compatible system, collection, endpoint or waepoint
